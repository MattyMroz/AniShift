"""Payload secret redaction for logs and event envelopes.

Single redaction rule: case-insensitive substring match against a
fixed set of known-sensitive key fragments. Used by:

* :class:`anishift.events.emitters.DbEventEmitter` before persisting
  ``payload_json`` rows.
* Logger scrubber and any caller that wants to render a dict safely.

The functions are pure — the input is never mutated; a freshly built
dict (and freshly built nested containers) is returned.
